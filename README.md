# Map Demo

Clicking on the map will add a target there (clicking on the target will remove it). Once targets are designated, their metadata can me modified by clicking on them in the 'Locations section'.

I used Leaflet and Mapbox for cartography, Bootstrap for responsive page layout, Underscore for some functional tools, and wrote about a hundred lines to make everything play nicely.
